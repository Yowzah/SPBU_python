\section{Introduction}

The necessity to study stability and limit dynamical regimes (attractors)
arises in classical theoretical and applied problems.
One of the first such problems is related to the design of automatic control systems,
which ensure the transition of the controlled object to the operating regime
and its stability with respect to external disturbances.
The first dynamical models of control systems were constructed in a way
that the operating regime corresponded to the unique globally stable equilibrium state.
After that models with oscillating operating regimes (periodic attractors)
and chaotic regimes (chaotic attractors) were obtained.
Later on, multistable models with different co-existing regimes (attractors)
were discovered.
Control of system states and their transfer into the basin of attraction of a desired attractor
is the subject for study of the oscillation control theory
(see e.g. \citep{FradkovP-1998,FradkovE-2005}).
One of the first theoretical problems on multistability is
the second part of the famous Hilbert's 16th problem
on the number and mutual disposition of coexisting periodic attractors in two-dimensional
polynomial systems.
For chaotic multidimensional dynamical systems a similar problem on
the number and mutual disposition of chaotic attractors and, in particular, their dependence
on the degree of polynomials in the model
is discussed in \citep{LeonovK-2015-AMC,KuznetsovLMPS-2018}.

For nonlinear systems with a unique equilibrium and bounded solutions,
the question arose: how to find a class of systems for which
the condition for the absence of the possibility for birth of self-excited oscillations
implies the absence of hidden oscillations\footnote{
In 2009, G.A.~Leonov and N.V.~Kuznetsov
proposed the classification of oscillations as being hidden or self-excited
and laid the foundations of the \emph{theory of hidden oscillations}, which
reflects the modern stage of development of the A.A. Andronov's theory of oscillations.
Self-excited oscillations can be visualized numerically
by a trajectory starting from a point in a neighborhood of an unstable equilibrium.
In contrast, the basin of attraction for a hidden oscillation is not connected with equilibria
and, thus is necessary to develop a special analytical-numerical methods
to find initial points for their visualization.
The current progress in the development of theory of hidden oscillations was
recently presented at a plenary lecture at
the 5th IFAC Conference on Analysis and Control of Chaotic Systems
(see \url{https://chaos2018.dc.wtb.tue.nl}).
} and the global stability of the equilibrium.
This problem has its origins in the Watt governor stability studies.
In 1877, I.A. Vyshnegradsky~\citep{Vyshnegradsky-1877}
for the closed dynamic model "machine + governor"
studied an approximate linear mathematical model without dry friction and
proposed the stability conditions
of the desired operating regime corresponding to the equilibrium state (trivial attractor).
However, the question about a rigorous proof of the Vyshnegradsky problem
on the validity of the linearization procedure for a system by discarding dry friction
remained open.
In 1885, M.H.~L\'{e}aut\'{e} showed~\citep{Leaute-1885} %for the first time
the possibility of the appearance of limit periodic oscillations in
dynamical models of control systems with dry friction.
After that, publications appeared (see e.g.~\citep[p.~6]{Zhukovsky-1909}),
which criticized Vyshnegradsky approach and questioned his conclusions.
In response to this criticism, A.A.~Andronov and A.G.~Maier~\citep{AndronovM-1944}
provided a rigorous global analysis of the nonlinear model of the Watt governor with dry friction
and proved the sufficiency of the Vyshnegradsky conditions
for the absence of limit oscillations and global stability of the operating regime\footnote{
  This result was specially remarked when in 1946 A.A.~Andronov was elected to
  the Academy of Sciences of the USSR where he
  became the first academician in control theory.
} (i.e. the existence of a rest segment that attracts trajectories from any initial data).
Further development and generalization of the results by Vyshnegradsky, Andronov and Maier
were done by G.A.~Leonov in~\citep{Leonov-1971} (see also survey \citep{LeonovKKM-2017}).

In 1949, inspirited by the discussion of the work~\citep{AndronovM-1944}
at the Andronov's scientific seminar in the Institute of Automation and Remote Control
(USSR Academy of Sciences, Moscow)~\citep{Bissell-1998},
M.A.~Aizerman formulated a new problem.
His question was whether
the sufficient conditions of global stability of
a class of nonlinear Lurie systems with a unique equilibrium
coincide with the necessary stability conditions
when the smooth nonlinearity belongs to the sector of linear stability~\citep{Aizerman-1949}.
Independently, a similar hypothesis was later advanced by R.E.~Kalman in 1957,
with the additional requirement that the derivative of nonlinearity
belong to the linear stability sector~\citep{Kalman-1957}:
\emph{''If $\varphi(\sigma)$ in Fig.~1
% [see Fig.~\ref{fig:kalman_scheme}]
is replaced by constants
$k$ corresponding to all possible values of $\varphi'(\sigma)$, and
it is found that the closed-loop system is stable for
all such $k$, then it is intuitively clear that the system
must be monostable; i.e. all transient solutions
will converge to a unique, stable critical point.''}
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{FIG/KalmanScheme.pdf}
  \caption{Nonlinear control system. $G(s)$ is a linear transfer
  function, $\varphi(\sigma)$ is a single-valued smooth function~\citep{Kalman-1957}.}
  \label{fig:kalman_scheme}
\end{figure}

Kalman's statement can be reformulated in the
following:
\begin{hypothesis}[The Kalman hypothesis]
  Consider the following control system in the Lurie form
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:main_lurie}
    \begin{array}{l}
    \dot{{\rm x}} = A {\rm x} + b \varphi(\sigma),\quad \sigma = c^{*}{\rm x},
    \end{array}
  \end{equation}
  where $A$ is a constant $n \times n$ matrix, $b$ and $c$ are constant
  $n$-dimensional columns, with all values being, sign $*$
  denotes the transpose, and $\varphi$ is a smooth scalar function with $\varphi(0) = 0$,
  satisfying the condition
  \begin{equation}\label{cond:kalman}
    k_1 < \varphi'(\sigma) < k_2, \quad \sigma \in (-\infty,+\infty),
  \end{equation}
  where $k_1$ is a number or $-\infty$, and $k_2$ is a number or $+\infty$.
  If the linear system $\dot{{\rm x}} = A {\rm x} + k b c^* {\rm x}$, with $k \in (k_1, k_2)$
  is asymptotically stable, then system \eqref{eq:main_lurie}
  is stable in large (i.e. a zero solution of system~\eqref{eq:main_lurie} is asymptotically stable
  and any solution tends to zero as $t \to +\infty$).
\end{hypothesis}

The Aizerman and Kalman hypothesises played an important role in
the theory of global stability for control systems
and set two directions for its further development --
the search and formulation of sufficient stability conditions
(see pioneering works~\citep{Popov-1961,Kal63,GeligLY-1978}),
as well as the construction of counterexamples for these hypothesises.
From the computational perspective, the latter problem is nontrivial,
since the oscillations in counterexamples are hidden,
i.e. their basin of attraction does not intersect with small neighborhood of an equilibrium.
Numerical calculation of initial data of such oscillations for their visualization
is a challenging problem.
Up to now all known counterexamples to the Kalman hypothesis were constructed in such a way
that one locally stable limit cycle (hidden oscillation) co-exists with a locally stable equilibrium.
In this paper we demonstrate a multistable configuration of three co-existing hidden oscillations (limit cycles)
and a locally stable equilibrium
in the phase space of the fourth-order system, which provides a new class of counterexamples
to the Kalman hypothesis.

\section{Previous counterexamples to Kalman hypothesis}
%Fitts
First known attempt to construct counterexamples to the Kalman hypothesis
was made by R.E.~Fitts~\citep{Fitts-1966},
who experimentally studied a fourth-order system
with a cubic nonlinearity.
As a result, Fitts experimentally observed a periodic solution of considered system.
% for some parameter values $K = 10$ and $\beta \in (0.01, 0.75)$.
%Barabanov
Later on, N.E.~Barabanov~\citep{Barabanov-1988} claimed that some Fitts' results
are not true and suggested to use discontinuous nonlinearity $\texttt{sign}(\cdot)$
to derive counterexamples analytically.
% for some of the parameter values considered by Fitts, namely,
% for $\beta \in (0.572, 0.75)$.
%Bernat-Libre
His work also raised critical discussions
in~\citep{BernatL-1996,Meisters-1996,UMN-1998}.
In particular, \cite{BernatL-1996} pointed out the necessity to rigorously analyze
non-local bifurcations while smoothing discontinuous nonlinearities.
They suggested
to start the procedure for constructing counterexamples
with a piecewise linear nonlinearity $\texttt{sat}(\cdot)$.
%Leonov-Kuznetsov
In \citep{BraginKL-2010-IFAC,BraginVKL-2011,LeonovK-2011-DAN},
it was introduced an effective approach for
construction of counterexamples to the Kalman hypothesis relying on
an analytical-numerical search for periodic solutions by applying harmonic balance and
numerical continuation methods and using smooth nonlinearity $\texttt{tanh}(\cdot)$.
For discrete-time systems \cite{HeathCS-2015} demonstrated that Kalman hypothesis
is false even for second-order systems using counterexamples
with stable periodic solutions\footnote{
    Remark that the difference between the dimensions of the phase spaces of a discrete-time system
    and a continuous-time system defined by autonomous ODE,
    for which the Kalman hypothesis is not true, is equal to 2.
    This value coincides with the difference between the dimensions of the spaces
    in which chaos can occur (for discrete-time systems the dimension is equal to 1,
    for continuous-time systems~--~3).
  % Here it is interesting to emphasize the difference between discrete-time systems
  % and continuous-time systems defined by autonomous ODE.
  % For the former, the Kalman hypothesis is false in two-dimensional case and
  % chaotic behavior can occur already in one-dimensional case, while for the latter
  % the hypothesis is false in four-dimensional case, while chaos can occur
  % in systems with at least three-dimensional phase space.
}.
Also construction of counterexamples to the Kalman hypothesis
is discussed in \citep{BurkinK-2014-HA}.

\section{Coexisting limit cycles}

% ���������� �� � ����� ����� (����� + �������).
To construct numerically a new counterexample to the Kalman hypothesis
providing three co-existing limit cycles
% � ���� ������� ��������� ���� ������ � ������������ �� (��)
we combined Fitts' linear system,
Barabanov's idea of considering $\texttt{sign}(\cdot)$,
and the idea from \citep{LeonovK-2011-DAN} to use numerical continuation procedure
while passing from $\texttt{sign}(\cdot)$ to $\texttt{tanh}(\cdot)$.

Consider the control system in the Lurie form~\eqref{eq:main_lurie}
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:main_lurie}
%   \begin{array}{l}
%   \dot{{\rm x}} = A {\rm x} + b \varphi(\sigma),\quad \sigma = c^{*}{\rm x},
%   \end{array}
% \end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:main:matricies}
  A\!=\!\left(
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
    -a_0 & -a_1 & -a_2 & -a_3
  \end{array}
  \right)\!\!, \
  b = \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
    0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1
    \end{array}
  \right)\!\!, \
  c = \left(
    \begin{array}{c}
    0 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 0
    \end{array}
  \right)\!\!,
\end{equation}
and $a_0 = (m_1^2+\beta^2)(m_2^2+\beta^2)$,
$a_1 = 2 \beta (m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 2 \beta^2)$,
$a_2 = m_1^2 + m_2^2 + 6 \beta^2$, $a_3 = 4 \beta$, $m_1 = 0.9, m_2 = 1.1,
\beta = 0.03$, $\varphi(\sigma) = \texttt{tanh}(\sigma / \varepsilon)$,
$\varepsilon = 0.01$.
The linear part of system \eqref{eq:main_lurie} is defined by the transfer function
\begin{equation}\label{eq:trFuncFitts}
  W(p) = \frac{p^2}{\left((p+\beta)^2 + m_1^2\right)\left((p+\beta)^2 + m_2^2\right)}.
\end{equation}

Initial data for visualization of periodic oscillations were obtained using
Andronov point mapping method~\citep{AndronovVKh-1966}\footnote{Other methods for searching periodic oscillations
of dynamical models with $\texttt{sign}(\cdot)$ nonlinearity
can be found e.g. in \citep{Tsypkin-1984,Boiko-2008}.}
for system \eqref{eq:main_lurie}, \eqref{eq:main:matricies}
with non-linearity $\varphi(\sigma) = \texttt{sign}(\sigma)$
and numerical continuation method\footnote{
The idea is to consider system \eqref{eq:main_lurie}, \eqref{eq:main:matricies}
  with the nonlinearity $\varphi(\sigma) = \texttt{sign}(\sigma)
  + \mu (\texttt{tanh}(\sigma / \varepsilon) - \texttt{sign}(\sigma))$, $\mu \in [0,1]$
  and to switch from the system with
  nonlinearity $\texttt{sign}(\cdot)$ to the system with a smooth nonlinearity
  $\texttt{tanh}(\cdot)$ by varying the parameter $\mu$ from $0$ to $1$ with some small step.
  During the switching on each next step,
  the initial point for a trajectory to be integrated is chosen
  as the last point of the trajectory integrated on the previous step.
} for smoothing the discontinuous nonlinearity
(see e.g.~\citep{LeonovK-2013-IJBC,LeonovKKM-2017}).
Corresponding initial points for each stable limit cycle
are presented below in Table~\ref{tb:initial_data_sign}.
In system \eqref{eq:main_lurie}, \eqref{eq:main:matricies}
with the smooth nonlinearity $\varphi(\sigma) = \texttt{tanh}(\sigma / \varepsilon)$,
$\varepsilon = 0.01$
for obtained initial points the trajectories were numerically integrated,
which after the transient process allows us to visualize
three hidden periodic attractors (see Fig.~\ref{fig:3LC_coexists} and
Table~\ref{tb:initial_data_tanh} with initial data).
For each periodic attractor, an additional analysis of the local basin of attraction was carried out
by choosing a grid of points in the vicinity of the periodic attractor and checking the attraction
of all the trajectories with initial data from these points to the periodic attractor.

\subsection{Sector of linear stability}

It can be seen that the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix at the
zero equilibrium are
\begin{equation*}
  -\beta \pm m_1 i, \qquad -\beta \pm m_2 i,
\end{equation*}
and, thus this equilibrium is locally stable.

Consider the matrix
\begin{equation}\label{eq:lin_matrix}
  A + kbc^{*} = \left(
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1  \\
    -a_0 & -a_1 & -a_2 - k & -a_3
  \end{array}
  \right).
\end{equation}
Characteristic polynomial of the matrix (\ref{eq:lin_matrix}) is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:char_polynom}
  \lambda^4 + a_3\lambda^3 + (a_2+k)\lambda^2 + a_1\lambda + a_0.
\end{equation}

Using Routh-Hurwitz criterion it is possible to show
that for each $\beta > 0$ the linear system $\dot{\rm x} = A {\rm x} + k \, b \, c^* {\rm x}$,
given by matrices \eqref{eq:main:matricies}, is globally asymptotically stable for
$$
  k \in \big(-4\beta^2 - \tfrac{(m_1^2 - m_2^2)^2}{2(2\beta^2 + m_1^2 + m_2^2)}, +\infty\big).
$$
All the roots of the characteristic polynomial~\eqref{eq:char_polynom} have negative real parts,
iff all the leading principal minors
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
  &\Delta_1 = a_3 = 4\beta, & \Delta_2 = a_3(a_2+k) - a_1, \\
  &\Delta_3 = a_1a_3k - a_1^2 + a_1a_2a_3-a_0a_3^2, & \Delta_4 = a_0\Delta_3
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
of the Hurwitz matrix
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:lin_matrix_hurwitz}
 \left(
  \begin{array}{cccc}
    a_3 & a_1 & 0 & 0 \\
    1 & a_2+k & a_0 & 0 \\
    0 & a_3 & a_1 & 1  \\
    0 & 1 & a_2 + k & a_0
  \end{array}
  \right)
\end{equation*}
are positive.
This implies the inequality $k > \frac{a_0a_3^2+a_1^2-a_1a_2a_3}{a_1a_3}$,
which defines a sector of linear stability.

\subsection{Describing function method and Popov criterion}
Let us show that the application of the classical describing function method\footnote{
  Describing function method belongs
  to the approximate methods of analysis of control systems
  and there exist various examples of systems for which it
  leads to incorrect results
  in both prediction of stability (see e.g.~\citep{BraginVKL-2011,LeonovK-2013-IJBC})
  and prediction of the existence of oscillations
  (see e.g.~\citep{LeonovK-2018-AIP,LeonovK-2018-DAN}).
} and Popov method
to system \eqref{eq:main_lurie}, \eqref{eq:main:matricies} demonstrates the necessity
of their further development to be able to obtain
the necessary and sufficient conditions for the
birth of oscillations and stability.

Suppose system~\eqref{eq:main_lurie}, \eqref{eq:main:matricies} has periodic solution
with amplitude $a$ and frequency $\omega_0$.
% $a \cos(\omega_0t)$.
Hence, according to the harmonic balance method, frequency of this solution can be found
from the following equality $\operatorname{Im} W(i\omega_0) = 0$
and, therefore, $\omega_0 = \sqrt{\beta^2+\frac{m_1^2+m_2^2}{2}} > 0$.
Also, from the equality $\operatorname{Re} W(i\omega_0) = 0$
% we get $k = -(\operatorname{Re} W(i\omega_0))^{-1} = - \left(4 \beta^2 + \frac{(m_1^2 - m_2^2)^2}{2 (2\beta^2 + m_1^2 + m_2^2)}\right) < 0$.
we can get a coefficient of harmonic linearization
\begin{equation*}
	k_{\rm hl} = -\frac{1}{\operatorname{Re} W(i\omega_0)} = - \left(4 \beta^2 + \frac{(m_1^2 - m_2^2)^2}{2 (2\beta^2 + m_1^2 + m_2^2)}\right) < 0.
\end{equation*}
The describing function is defined as follows:
\begin{equation}
		\begin{array}{ll}
			\Phi(a) =&  \int\limits_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}} {\rm tanh} (\cos(\omega_0t)a)\cos(\omega_0t)dt - \\
			& - ak_{\rm hl}\int\limits_{0}^{\frac{2\pi}{\omega_0}}(\cos(\omega_0t))^2dt \geq -\frac{\pi ak_{\rm hl}}{\omega_0}.
		\end{array}
\end{equation}

If $a \neq 0$, then $\Phi(a) > 0$ and there is no such $a$ that $\Phi(a) = 0$.
Therefore, there are no periodic solutions in the system~(\ref{eq:main_lurie})
according to the describing function method.

Consider the Popov criterion on the absolute stability
(see e.g. \citep[p.~961]{Popov-1961},\cite[p.~79]{YakubovichLG-2004})
for system \eqref{eq:main_lurie}, \eqref{eq:main:matricies}
and non-linearity $\varphi(\sigma) = \texttt{tanh}(\sigma)$.
First two conditions of the Popov criterion, i.e. asymptotic stability of the linear part and
$0 \leq \frac{\tanh(\sigma)}{\sigma} \leq \infty, \sigma \neq 0, \tanh(0) = 0$, are satisfied.
The third condition of the Popov criterion has the following form:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:popov}
	\begin{aligned}
		&\operatorname{Re}[(1+i\omega\vartheta)W(i\omega)] = \operatorname{Re}W(i\omega) - \omega\vartheta\operatorname{Im}W(i\omega) \geq 0 \Leftrightarrow \\
		&-\omega^2(\omega^4-\omega^2a_2+a_0) \geq 2\vartheta\omega^4\beta\left(-2\omega^2+\frac{a_1}{2\beta}\right).
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

If $\omega = 0$, then this inequality holds.
Else, if $\omega \neq 0$, then this condition takes the form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:popov:cond3}
		(4\vartheta\beta-1)\omega^4 - (\vartheta a_1 - a_2)\omega^2-a_0 \geq 0.
\end{equation}
Note that since $a_0 >0$, then for each $\vartheta \geq 0$ there exists small
enough $\omega > 0$ such that \eqref{eq:popov:cond3} is not true.
Therefore, the conditions of the criterion are not satisfied.

\section{Conclusion}

Thus, the results obtained here show the limits of applicability of existing analytical methods
and demonstrate the difficulty of identifying classes of systems for which
it is possible to match the necessary and sufficient conditions for global stability.

In the general case, when considering various nonlinearities, it is possible to synthesize
systems with a large number of coexisting attractors (equilibria, limit cycles, chaotic attractors),
see e.g.~\citep{WangC-2013,ZhangC-2017,StankevichKLC-2017,KuznetsovKLMS-2017-IFAC,ChenKLM-2017-IJBC}.
However, in these examples
the nonlinearities were non-scalar, or
the derivatives of the nonlinearities changed their signs.
Therefore, these nonlinearities did not satisfy the conditions of Kalman hypothesis.
In this article, we demonstrate new counterexample to the Kalman hypothesis with
three co-existing stable limit cycles.
The mutual disposition
of co-existing attractors in counterexamples to the Kalman hypothesis
(depending on the dimension of the system)
and possibility of managing the number of attractors
(e.g. finding the maximum possible number of attractors)
are open problems for the further study.
